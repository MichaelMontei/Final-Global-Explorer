# Global Explorer
- Made by @PabloGP18, @MichaelMontei, @alex197925 and @z3no
*This is our first group project at BeCode, the goal is to learn and work together, divide tasks among each other and set up a good working structure. Thus we learn how to complete a project so it can be delivered to a client.*

## Our project
For our group project we created a travel agency that sells active exploring packages.
So it's not your average holiday vacation. We want people to explore their destination in an active way, we want to connect them with nature.

We made 5 different pages:

- [Homepage]() *with a parallax image header*
- [Services]() *with bootstrap cards*
- [Team]() *with bootstrap cards*
- [Testimonials]() *with a carousel*
- [Contact]() *with a contact form*
